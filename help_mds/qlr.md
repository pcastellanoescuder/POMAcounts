#### Spectral counts differential expression by quasi-likelihood GLM

Given a null and an alternative model, with a **two level** treatment factor as the two conditions to compare, executes a quasi-likelihood based GLM regression to discover differentially expressed features between the two conditions. The null and alternative models may include blocking factors. The reference level of the main factor is considered to be the control condition.
