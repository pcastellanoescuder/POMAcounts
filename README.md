<h2 style="color:black">Overview</h2>

POMAcounts is a web-based tool for exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis of mass spectrometry spectral counts data. This GUI is based on the R/Bioconductor packages [msmsEDA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msmsEDA.html) (Gregori et al., 2020a) and [msmsTests](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msmsTests.html) (Gregori et al., 2020b). The name of POMAcounts is given by the large similarity of both the frontend and the backend that it shares with [POMAShiny](https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/POMAShiny) web application. POMAcounts is hosted at [http://uebshiny.vhir.org:3838/POMAcounts](http://uebshiny.vhir.org:3838/POMAcounts).
